## Project overview:  
This project contains analysis to determine the best neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh! We have defined "bestness" to be the neighborhood that is greatest for this group to live in. This means that the winning neighborhood has a sense of culture integrity, safety, and convenient parking. As a result of these metrics, it is important to note that the winning neighborhood is consequently a great place for Asian people! Very practical knowledge for new International students.
