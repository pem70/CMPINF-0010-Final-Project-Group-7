## Project overview:  
This project contains analysis to determine the best neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh! We have defined "bestness" to be the neighborhood that is greatest for Halloween trick-or-treating. This means that the winning neighborhood has a sense of community, is great for families, and is located in a wealthier residential area. As a result of this silly metric, it is important to note that the winning neighborhood is consequently a great place for kids to grow up in! Very practical knowledge for new Pittsburgh parents.
